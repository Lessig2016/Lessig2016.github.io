* got through the collection phase
* working on enrichment phase
* Looks like a pretty good tool with lots of useful pieces.
*   tracking page views, custom events, and active time on site
*   writing to S3 with a 1-hour delay
*   However:
  *   there will be a bit of a lift to use it to serve different content
  *   Dashboarding solution would still be needed

2\. Discussion of Kissmetrics vs. Snowplow

*   Clear the Kissmetrics, in the short term, will provide us with the event tracking we need and the ability to direct people based on past events they’ve taken
*   Will be able to easily meet the short term goal of changing the top bar as a function of whether someone is already signed up for email or not
*   Still need to integrate other data sources into this
*   QUESTION: Where are the data sources? How to access, and who will write ETL to get things into Kissmetrics


*   Short-term
  *   Let’s use both services to collect event data, but use Kissmetrics for re-directing
*   Longer-term
  *   See point 4 below

3\. Train a proper model to do realtime evaluation

* eg: content suggestions, user scoring
* tabled for now (but possibly use vowpal wabbit eventually?)



4\. David Maust suggested using a Retargeting Service


*   Need realtime service to track attributes / segments by cookie ID
*   Simple JSONP response with mongodb backend may work well.
*   Two API Calls:

*   Get existing segments
*   Add segment

```
    Request: /api/recordSegment?id=donated

            Response: Blank



    Request: /api/getSegments?p=handleSegments

    Response:

            handleSegments({

                    cookieId: c3b6f4e0-42d2-42e3-81a9-64a40376070c

                    donated: true

            })
```


Next Steps:

1.  Kissmetrics
  *   Get basic tags in the site merged [M.David]
  *   does the code deal with cross-domain tracking? [M.David]
  *   Merge data from different sources on Lessig site and ETL into Kissmetrics [Dan]
  *   What data sources do we need to integrate (email ,pledge, teams...)? [Gabriel]
  *   Difficulty of integrating email info? 
  *   Figuring out some more detailed tracking of events on the site [M.David]
     *   specifically - donation flow
  *   
2.  Snowplow
  *   Transition the collector to Lessig campaign account [David M.]
  *   Build instructions for transition [David M.]
  *   Someone with AWS access: follow instructions to create bucket and collector [Gabriel/Chris]
  *   David: Create pull request [David M.]
