### Campaign's Big Data Objectives

* @aaronlifshin discussed the high level big data objectives of the campaign
    * Lessig gathers great talent
    * Goal to create software for better organizing and serving users
    * Identify user's passion issues (CFR does not inspire enough passion)
    * Present more relevant content to increase understanding of CFR, inspire passion and drive campaign objectives
    * Identify visitor's political skew, libertarian, progressive, etc.
    * Grow a database of supporters of issues most important to the campaign
    * Follow users across campaign's many projects, including lessig2016.us, fixdemocracyfirst.us, etc.
* @aaronlifshin discussed currently available and usable data points
    * mailing list subscriptions
    * donations
* @aaronlifshin demonstrated a use case on the site:
    * top-of-page real estate should not be used to show mailing list to a current subscriber
    * should be used for driving toward other objectives

### Open Discussion

* @gg discussed some additional goals
    * Drive people to signups
    * Repeat donations from existing donors
    * Identify/reach new voters
    * Get Lessig into debates
* @aschober discussed some goals
    * determine better use of advertising spend
* @dmaust suggested evaluating the value of a user, as acquired by source
* @dmaust asked
    * What are the conversion metrics?
    * How could we determine if user placed call to get Lessig in debate?
* @data_dan suggested we start aggregating baseline user data and slowly aggregate more specific data - conversions, donations, twitter, etc.

### Kissmetrics

* @gg Led the discussion about [Kissmetrics](https://kissmetrics.com/).
    * arbitrary event capture that links events to users
    * as user moves through funnels, we link additional events/identities
    * interface allows you to model funnels, dropoff
    * really easy to get raw data for analysis - batch sync to S3 (not real-time)
    * data is in JSON format, one object per event
    * sessionization
    * kissmetrics cookie is cross-domain
    * supports basic page views/referrers
    * supports data import for retroactive visitor analysis
        * drive user back to site to attach analysis to browser (user id to cookie to associate data to user)
* @aschober recommended implementing different analytics tools that play to their different strengths
* @dmaust mentioned [Snowplow](http://snowplowanalytics.com/)
    * "not pretty stuff" but open source
* @aschober mentioned [segment](https://segment.com/)
    * route data to lots of analytics platforms
* @gg discussed [Kissmetrics pricing](https://kissmetrics.com/pricing)
    * not super cheap
    * but sub 100/mo maaaybe 200/mo?
* Some likely next steps:
    * Set up Kissmetrics account
    * Create S3 bucket
    * Implement scripting to websites for baseline data aggregation (views, referrers, etc.)
    * Implement user events for more granular data aggregation
    * Research A/B testing capabilities of Kissmetrics
    * Add issue pages for harvesting visitor intent
    * Import data for retroactive analysis

### Consensus

* Consensus was achieved to implement Kissmetrics for our initial analytics platform, pending budget approval.

### Project Lead

* @mdavid volunteered and was appointed as Project Lead.

### Action items

* @furf request budget approval for Kissmetrics
* @mdavid to deliver plan of action by EOW
* @mdavid to examine A/B testing capabilities of Kissmetrics
* @bucchere to set up Kissmetrics account
* @bucchere to set up S3 bucket for raw data storage
