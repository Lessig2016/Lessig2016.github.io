We will discuss the previous week's progress and the following week's needs and events. We will try our best to answer questions and address concerns within the allotted time.

Meeting agendas and minutes will be recorded in the [meetings](https://github.com/Lessig2016/Lessig2016.github.io/tree/master/meetings) directory of this repository. *Please contact the [Tech Volunteer Coordinator][tvc] if you would like to volunteer to record the minutes.*

## Forums

Team Lessig Tech also provides an open forum for the discussion of campaign strategy and tactics, technical implementations and ideas on [Google Groups][gg].

## Contributing

Team Lessig Tech values the contributions of all of its volunteers and seeks to facilitate engagement and collaboration with each of its projects. We encourage volunteers of every skill level to contribute and we will make every effort to ensure 

We promote transparency, which is why even the team's policies and practices are maintained in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lessig2016/Lessig2016.github.io/). If you have a suggestion on how to improve our process, would like to make a correction, follow our [standard approach for contributing code](https://github.com/Lessig2016/Lessig2016.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a pull request containing your changes to our documentation.

*For example, if you would like to change the time of the weekly "wake up" call, you would fork this repo, edit the time and submit a pull request. The merits of your change will be discussed inline and, if your change is appoved, it will be merged, changing the time of the call. :clap:*
